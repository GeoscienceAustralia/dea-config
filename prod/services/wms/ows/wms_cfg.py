A `weighted geometric medianâ approach has been used to estimate the median surface reflectance of the barest state (i.e., least vegetation) observed through Landsat-8 OLI observations from 2013 to September 2018 to generate a six-band Landsat-8 Barest Earth pixel composite mosaic over the Australian continent.

The bands include BLUE (0.452 - 0.512), GREEN (0.533 - 0.590), RED, (0.636 - 0.673) NIR (0.851 - 0.879), SWIR1 (1.566 - 1.651) and SWIR2 (2.107 - 2.294) wavelength regions. The weighted median approach is robust to outliers (such as cloud, shadows, saturation, corrupted pixels) and also maintains the relationship between all the spectral wavelengths in the spectra observed through time. The product reduces the influence of vegetation and allows for more direct mapping of soil and rock mineralogy.

Mangrove canopy cover version 1, 25 metre, 100km tile, Australian Albers Equal Area projection (EPSG:3577). Data is only visible at higher resolutions; when zoomed-out the available area will be displayed as a shaded region.

The mangrove canopy cover product provides valuable information about the extent and canopy density of mangroves for each year between 1987 and 2016 for the entire Australian coastline.
The canopy cover classes are:
20-50% (pale green), 50-80% (mid green), 80-100% (dark green).

The product consists of  a sequence (one per year) of 25 meter resolution maps that are generated by analysing the Landsat fractional cover (https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.94250.v1) developed by the Joint Remote Sensing Research Program and the Global Mangrove Watch layers (https://doi.org/10.1071/MF13177) developed by the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency.

The mangrove canopy cover version 1 product has the following caveats:
it underestimates the overall extent of mangroves.
it doesnât detect small mangrove communities i.e. smaller estuaries in NSW and Victoria
that there is localised confusion between mangroves and wooded freshwater wetlands i.e. Melaleuca swamps, and
in some locations dense dwarf/shrub mangroves that are less than 2 metres tall may be mis-labelled as woodland/open forest/closed forest.

Water Observations from Space (WOfS) Filtered Statistics helps provide the long term understanding of the recurrence of water in the landscape, with much of the noise due to misclassification filtered out. WOfS Filtered Statistics consists of a Confidence layer that compares the WOfS Statistics water summary to other national water datasets, and the Filtered Water Summary which uses the Confidence to mask areas of the WOfS Statistics water summary where Confidence is low. 

This layer is Filtered Water Summary: A simplified version of the Water Summary, showing the frequency of water observations where the Confidence is above a cutoff level.  No clear observations of water causes an area to appear transparent, few clear observations of water correlate with red and yellow colours, deep blue and purple correspond to an area being wet through 90%-100% of clear observations.

The Filtered Water Summary layer is a noise-reduced view of surface water across Australia. Even though confidence filtering is applied to the Filtered Water Summary, some cloud and shadow, and sensor noise does persist.

Water Observations from Space (WOfS) Statistics is a set of statistical summaries of the WOfS product that combines the many years of WOfS observations into summary products which help the understanding of surface water across Australia.  The layers available are: the count of clear observations; the count of wet observations; the percentage of wet observations over time. 

This layer contains Wet Count: how many times water was detected in observations that were clear. No clear observations of water causes an area to appear transparent, 1-50 total clear observations of water correlate with red and yellow colours, 100 clear observations of water correlate with green, 200 clear observations of water correlates with light blue, 300 clear observations of water correlates to deep blue and 400 and over observations of clear water correlate to purple.

As no confidence filtering is applied to this product, it is affected by noise where misclassifications have occurred in the WOfS water classifications, and hence can be difficult to interpret on its own. The confidence layer and filtered summary are contained in the Water Observations from Space Statistics Filtered Summary product, which provide a noise-reduced view of the water summary.

Water Observations from Space (WOfS) Statistics is a set of statistical summaries of the WOfS product which combines WOfS observations into summary products that help the understanding of surface water across Australia. WOfS Statistics is calculated from the full depth time series (1986 â 2018). The water detected for each location is summed through time and then compared to the number of clear observations of that location. The result is a percentage value of the number of times water was observed at the location. The layers available are: the count of clear observations; the count of wet observations; the percentage of wet observations over time (water summary). 

This layer contains the Water Summary: the percentage of clear observations which were detected as wet (ie. the ratio of wet to clear as a percentage). No clear observations of water causes an area to appear transparent, few clear observations of water correlate with red and yellow colours, deep blue and purple correspond to an area being wet through 90%-100% of clear observations.

As no confidence filtering is applied to this product, it is affected by noise where misclassifications have occurred in the WOfS water classifications, and hence can be difficult to interpret on its own. The confidence layer and filtered summary are contained in the Water Observations from Space Statistics Filtered Summary product, which provide a noise-reduced view of the water summary.

Water Observations from Space (WOfS) Filtered Statistics helps provide the long term understanding of the recurrence of water in the landscape, with much of the noise due to misclassification filtered out. WOfS Filtered Statistics consists of a Confidence layer that compares the WOfS Statistics water summary to other national water datasets, and the Filtered Water Summary which uses the Confidence to mask areas of the WOfS Statistics water summary where Confidence is low.
 
This layer is Confidence: the degree of agreement between water shown in the Water Summary and other national datasets. Areas where there is less than 1% confidence appears black, areas with confidence for between 1% 10% confidence are styled between black and red, areas with 25% confidence are styled yellow, areas with 75% confidence and above correspond to green.

The Confidence layer provides understanding of whether the water shown in the Water Summary agrees with where water should exist in the landscape, such as due to sloping land or whether water has been detected in a location by other means.

Water Observations from Space - Annual Statistics is a set of annual statistical summaries of the water observations contained in WOfS. The layers available are: the count of clear observations; the count of wet observations; the percentage of wet observations over time.

This product is Water Observations from Space - Annual Statistics, a set of annual statistical summaries of the WOfS product that combines the many years of WOfS observations into summary products that help the understanding of surface water across Australia. As no confidence filtering is applied to this product, it is affected by noise where misclassifications have occurred in the WOfS water classifications, and hence can be difficult to interpret on its own.
The confidence layer and filtered summary are contained in the Water Observations from Space Statistics - Filtered Summary product, which provide a noise-reduced view of the water summary.

This layer contains Water Summary: what percentage of clear observations were detected as wet (ie. the ratio of wet to clear as a percentage). No clear observations of water causes an area to appear transparent, 1-50 total clear observations of water correlate with red and yellow colours, 100 clear observations of water correlate with green, 200 clear observations of water correlates with light blue, 300 clear observations of water correlates to deep blue and 400 and over observations of clear water correlate to purple.

The confidence layer and filtered summary are contained in the Water Observations from Space Statistics - Filtered Summary product, which provide a noise-reduced view of the water summary.

This layer contains Water Summary: what percentage of clear observations were detected as wet (ie. the ratio of wet to clear as a percentage). No clear observations of water causes an area to appear transparent, few clear observations of water correlate with red and yellow colours, deep blue and purple correspond to an area being wet through 90%-100% of clear observations.

Water Observations from Space - April to October Statistics is a set of seasonal statistical summaries of the water observations contained in WOfS. The layers available are: the count of clear observations; the count of wet observations; the percentage of wet observations over time.

This product is Water Observations from Space - April to October Statistics, a set of seasonal statistical summaries of the WOfS product that combines the many years of WOfS observations into summary products that help the understanding of surface water across Australia. As no confidence filtering is applied to this product, it is affected by noise where misclassifications have occurred in the WOfS water classifications, and hence can be difficult to interpret on its own.
The confidence layer and filtered summary are contained in the Water Observations from Space Statistics - Filtered Summary product, which provide a noise-reduced view of the water summary.

This layer contains Water Summary: what percentage of clear observations were detected as wet (ie. the ratio of wet to clear as a percentage). No clear observations causes an area to appear transparent, 1-300 total clear observations of water correlate with red and yellow colours, 400 clear observations correlates with light green, 800 clear observations and above correlates with dark green.

Water Observations from Space - November to March Statistics is a set of seasonal statistical summaries of the water observations contained in WOfS. The layers available are: the count of clear observations; the count of wet observations; the percentage of wet observations over time.

This product is Water Observations from Space - November to March Statistics, a set of seasonal statistical summaries of the WOfS product that combines the many years of WOfS observations into summary products that help the understanding of surface water across Australia. As no confidence filtering is applied to this product, it is affected by noise where misclassifications have occurred in the WOfS water classifications, and hence can be difficult to interpret on its own.

Water Observations from Space - Seasonal Statistics is a set of seasonal statistical summaries of the water observations contained in WOfS. The layers available are: the count of clear observations; the count of wet observations; the percentage of wet observations over time.

This product is Water Observations from Space - November to March Statistics, a set of seasonal statistical summaries of the WOfS product that combines the many years of WOfS observations into summary products that help the understanding of surface water across Australia. As no confidence filtering is applied to this product, it is affected by noise where misclassifications have occurred in the WOfS water classifications, and hence can be difficult to interpret on its own.
The confidence layer and filtered summary are contained in the Water Observations from Space Statistics - Filtered Summary product, which provide a noise-reduced view of the water summary.

This layer contains Water Summary: what percentage of clear observations were detected as wet (ie. the ratio of wet to clear as a percentage). No clear observations of water causes an area to appear transparent, few clear observations of water correlate with red and yellow colours, deep blue and purple correspond to an area being wet through 90%-100% of clear observations.

Water Observations from Space (WOfS) provides surface water observations derived from satellite imagery for all of Australia. The current product (Version 2.1.5) includes observations taken from 1986 to the present, from the Landsat 5, 7 and 8 satellites. WOfS covers all of mainland Australia and Tasmania but excludes off-shore Territories.

The WOfS product allows users to get a better understanding of where water is normally present in a landscape, where water is seldom observed, and where inundation has occurred occasionally.

Data is provided as Water Observation Feature Layers (WOFLs), in a 1 to 1 relationship with the input satellite data. Hence there is one WOFL for each satellite dataset processed for the occurrence of water. The details of the WOfS algorithm and derived statistics are available at http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2015.11.003.

The Normalised Difference Chlorophyll Index (NDCI) is based on the method of Mishra & Mishra 2012, and adapted to bands on the Sentinel-2A & B sensors.
The index indicates levels of chlorophyll-a (chl-a) concentrations in complex turbid productive waters such as those encountered in many inland water bodies. The index has not been validated in Australian waters, and there are a range of environmental conditions that may have an effect on the accuracy of the derived index values in this test implementation, including:
- Influence on the remote sensing signal from nearby land and/or atmospheric effects
- Optically shallow water
- Cloud cover

This is a 90-day rolling archive of daily Sentinel-2 Near Real Time data. The Near Real-Time capability provides analysis-ready data that is processed on receipt using the best-available ancillary information at the time to provide atmospheric corrections.

The Normalised Difference Chlorophyll Index (NDCI) is based on the method of Mishra & Mishra 2012, and adapted to bands on the Sentinel-2A & B sensors.
The index indicates levels of chlorophyll-a (chl-a) concentrations in complex turbid productive waters such as those encountered in many inland water bodies. The index has not been validated in Australian waters, and there are a range of environmental conditions that may have an effect on the accuracy of the derived index values in this test implementation, including:
- Influence on the remote sensing signal from nearby land and/or atmospheric effects
- Optically shallow water
- Cloud cover

The Normalised Difference Chlorophyll Index (NDCI) is based on the method of Mishra & Mishra 2012, and adapted to bands on the Sentinel-2A & B sensors.
The index indicates levels of chlorophyll-a (chl-a) concentrations in complex turbid productive waters such as those encountered in many inland water bodies. The index has not been validated in Australian waters, and there are a range of environmental conditions that may have an effect on the accuracy of the derived index values in this test implementation, including:
- Influence on the remote sensing signal from nearby land and/or atmospheric effects
- Optically shallow water
- Cloud cover

This is a definitive archive of daily Sentinel-2 data. This is processed using correct ancillary data to provide a more accurate product than the Near Real Time.

The Surface Reflectance product has been corrected to account for variations caused by atmospheric properties, sun position and sensor view angle at time of image capture. These corrections have been applied to all satellite imagery in the Sentinel-2 archive.

The Normalised Difference Chlorophyll Index (NDCI) is based on the method of Mishra & Mishra 2012, and adapted to bands on the Sentinel-2A & B sensors.
The index indicates levels of chlorophyll-a (chl-a) concentrations in complex turbid productive waters such as those encountered in many inland water bodies. The index has not been validated in Australian waters, and there are a range of environmental conditions that may have an effect on the accuracy of the derived index values in this test implementation, including:
- Influence on the remote sensing signal from nearby land and/or atmospheric effects
- Optically shallow water
- Cloud cover

                "abstract": """A Multi-scale topographic position image of Australia has been generated by combining 
            a topographic position index and topographic ruggedness. Topographic Position Index (TPI) measures 
            the topographic slope position of landforms. Ruggedness informs on the roughness of the surface and 
            is calculated as the standard deviation of elevations. Both these terrain attributes are therefore 
            scale dependent and will vary according to the size of the analysis window. Based on an algorithm 
            developed by Lindsay et al. (2015) we have generated multi-scale topographic position model over the 
            Australian continent using 3 second resolution (~90m) DEM derived from the Shuttle Radar Topography 
            Mission (SRTM). The algorithm calculates topographic position scaled by the corresponding ruggedness 
            across three spatial scales (window sizes) of 0.2-8.1 Km; 8.2-65.2 Km and 65.6-147.6 Km. The derived 
            ternary image captures variations in topographic position across these spatial scales (blue local, 
            green intermediate and red regional) and gives a rich representation of nested landform features that 
            have broad application in understanding geomorphological and hydrological processes and in mapping

Fractional Cover Percentiles version 2.2.0, 25 metre, 100km tile, Australian Albers Equal Area projection (EPSG:3577). Data is only visible at higher resolutions; when zoomed-out the available area will be displayed as a shaded region.
Fractional cover provides information about the the proportions of green vegetation, non-green vegetation (including deciduous trees during autumn, dry grass, etc.), and bare areas for every 25m x 25m ground footprint. Fractional cover provides insight into how areas of dry vegetation and/or bare soil and green vegetation are changing over time. The percentile summaries are designed to make it easier to analyse and interpret fractional cover. Percentiles provide an indicator of where an observation sits, relative to the rest of the observations for the pixel. For example, the 90th percentile is the value below which 90% of the observations fall. The fractional cover algorithm was developed by the Joint Remote Sensing Research Program, for more information please see data.auscover.org.au/xwiki/bin/view/Product+pages/Landsat+Fractional+Cover

This contains the percentage of green vegetation per pixel at the 10th, 50th (median) and 90th percentiles for observations acquired in each full calendar year (1st of January - 31st December) from 1987 to the most recent full calendar year.

Fractional Cover products use Water Observations from Space (WOfS) to mask out areas of water, cloud and other phenomena. To be considered in the FCP product a pixel must have had at least 10 clear observations over the year.

Fractional Cover Percentiles version 2.2.0, 25 metre, 100km tile, Australian Albers Equal Area projection (EPSG:3577). Data is only visible at higher resolutions; when zoomed-out the available area will be displayed as a shaded region.
Fractional cover provides information about the the proportions of green vegetation, non-green vegetation (including deciduous trees during autumn, dry grass, etc.), and bare areas for every 25m x 25m ground footprint. Fractional cover provides insight into how areas of dry vegetation and/or bare soil and green vegetation are changing over time. The percentile summaries are designed to make it easier to analyse and interpret fractional cover. Percentiles provide an indicator of where an observation sits, relative to the rest of the observations for the pixel. For example, the 90th percentile is the value below which 90% of the observations fall. The fractional cover algorithm was developed by the Joint Remote Sensing Research Program, for more information please see data.auscover.org.au/xwiki/bin/view/Product+pages/Landsat+Fractional+Cover

This contains the percentage of non-green vegetation per pixel at the 10th, 50th (median) and 90th percentiles for observations acquired in each full calendar year (1st of January - 31st December) from 1987 to the most recent full calendar year.

Fractional Cover products use Water Observations from Space (WOfS) to mask out areas of water, cloud and other phenomena. To be considered in the FCP product a pixel must have had at least 10 clear observations over the year.

Fractional Cover Percentiles version 2.2.0, 25 metre, 100km tile, Australian Albers Equal Area projection (EPSG:3577). Data is only visible at higher resolutions; when zoomed-out the available area will be displayed as a shaded region.
Fractional cover provides information about the the proportions of green vegetation, non-green vegetation (including deciduous trees during autumn, dry grass, etc.), and bare areas for every 25m x 25m ground footprint. Fractional cover provides insight into how areas of dry vegetation and/or bare soil and green vegetation are changing over time. The percentile summaries are designed to make it easier to analyse and interpret fractional cover. Percentiles provide an indicator of where an observation sits, relative to the rest of the observations for the pixel. For example, the 90th percentile is the value below which 90% of the observations fall. The fractional cover algorithm was developed by the Joint Remote Sensing Research Program.

This contains a three band combination of the 50th Percentile for green vegetation, non green vegetation and bare soil observations acquired in each full calendar year (1st of January - 31st December) from 1987 to the most recent full calendar year.

Fractional Cover products use Water Observations from Space (WOfS) to mask out areas of water, cloud and other phenomena. To be considered in the FCP product a pixel must have had at least 10 clear observations over the year.

Fractional Cover Percentiles version 2.2.0, 25 metre, 100km tile, Australian Albers Equal Area projection (EPSG:3577). Data is only visible at higher resolutions; when zoomed-out the available area will be displayed as a shaded region.
Fractional cover provides information about the the proportions of green vegetation, non-green vegetation (including deciduous trees during autumn, dry grass, etc.), and bare areas for every 25m x 25m ground footprint. Fractional cover provides insight into how areas of dry vegetation and/or bare soil and green vegetation are changing over time. The percentile summaries are designed to make it easier to analyse and interpret fractional cover. Percentiles provide an indicator of where an observation sits, relative to the rest of the observations for the pixel. For example, the 90th percentile is the value below which 90% of the observations fall. The fractional cover algorithm was developed by the Joint Remote Sensing Research Program, for more information please see data.auscover.org.au/xwiki/bin/view/Product+pages/Landsat+Fractional+Cover

 FC-PERCENTILE-SEASONAL-SUMMARY, this contains a (10th, 50th and 90th percentile) of BS, PV and NPV of observations acquired within each calendar season (DJF, MAM, JJA, SON). This product is available for the most recent 8 seasons

Fractional Cover products use Water Observations from Space (WOfS) to mask out areas of water, cloud and other phenomena. To be considered in the FCP product a pixel must have had at least 10 clear observations over the year.

Fractional Cover Percentiles version 2.2.0, 25 metre, 100km tile, Australian Albers Equal Area projection (EPSG:3577). Data is only visible at higher resolutions; when zoomed-out the available area will be displayed as a shaded region.
Fractional cover provides information about the the proportions of green vegetation, non-green vegetation (including deciduous trees during autumn, dry grass, etc.), and bare areas for every 25m x 25m ground footprint. Fractional cover provides insight into how areas of dry vegetation and/or bare soil and green vegetation are changing over time.  The percentile summaries are designed to make it easier to analyse and interpret fractional cover. Percentiles provide an indicator of where an observation sits, relative to the rest of the observations for the pixel. For example, the 90th percentile is the value below which 90% of the observations fall. The fractional cover algorithm was developed by the Joint Remote Sensing Research Program for more information please see data.auscover.org.au/xwiki/bin/view/Product+pages/Landsat+Fractional+Cover

FC-PERCENTILE-SEASONAL-SUMMARY, this contains a (10th, 50th and 90th percentile) of BS, PV and NPV of observations acquired within each calendar season (DJF, MAM, JJA, SON). This product is available for the most recent 8 seasons
Fractional Cover products use Water Observations from Space (WOfS) to mask out areas of water, cloud and other phenomena. To be considered in the FCP product a pixel must have had at least 10 clear observations over the year.

The National Intertidal Digital Elevation Model (NIDEM; Bishop-Taylor et al. 2019) is a continental-scale elevation dataset for Australia's exposed intertidal zone. NIDEM provides the first three-dimensional representation of Australia's intertidal sandy beaches and shores, tidal flats and rocky shores and reefs at 25 m spatial resolution, addressing a key gap between the availability of sub-tidal bathymetry and terrestrial elevation data. NIDEM was generated by combining global tidal modelling with a 30-year time series archive of spatially and spectrally calibrated Landsat satellite data managed within the Digital Earth Australia (DEA) platform. NIDEM complements existing intertidal extent products, and provides data to support a new suite of use cases that require a more detailed understanding of the three-dimensional topography of the intertidal zone, such as hydrodynamic modelling, coastal risk management and ecological habitat mapping.
                            
*Overview*
                
Intertidal environments support important ecological habitats (e.g. sandy beaches and shores, tidal flats and rocky shores and reefs), and provide many valuable benefits such as storm surge protection, carbon storage and natural resources for recreational and commercial use. However, intertidal zones are faced with increasing threats from coastal erosion, land reclamation (e.g. port construction), and sea level rise. Accurate elevation data describing the height and shape of the coastline is needed to help predict when and where these threats will have the greatest impact. However, this data is expensive and challenging to map across the entire intertidal zone of a continent the size of Australia.

The rise and fall of the ocean can be used to describe the three-dimensional shape of the coastline by mapping the land-sea boundary (or 'waterline') across a range of known tides (e.g. low tide, high tide). Assuming that these waterlines represent lines of constant height relative to mean sea level (MSL), elevations can be modelled for the area of coastline located between the lowest and highest observed tide. To model the elevation of Australia's entire intertidal zone, 30 years of satellite images of the coastline (between 1986 and 2016 inclusive) were obtained from the archive of spatially and spectrally calibrated Landsat observations managed within the Digital Earth Australia (DEA) platform. Using the improved tidal modelling framework of the Intertidal Extents Model v2.0 (ITEM 2.0; Sagar et al. 2017, 2018), each satellite observation in the 30 year time series could be accurately associated with a modelled tide height using the global TPX08 ocean tidal model. These satellite observations were converted into a water index (NDWI), composited into discrete ten percent intervals of the observed tide range (e.g. the lowest 10% of observed tides etc), and used to extract waterlines using a spatially consistent and automated waterline extraction procedure. Triangulated irregular network (TIN) interpolation was then used to derive elevations relative to modelled mean sea level for each 25 x 25 m Landsat pixel across approximately 15,387 sq. km of intertidal terrain along Australia's entire coastline.

NIDEM differs from previous methods used to model the elevation of the intertidal zone which have predominately focused on extracting waterlines from a limited selection of satellite images using manual digitisation and visual interpretation (e.g. Chen and Rau 1998; Zhao et al. 2008; Liu et al. 2013; Chen et al. 2016). This manual process introduces subjectivity, is impractical to apply at a continental-scale, and has inherent restrictions based on the availability of high quality image data at appropriate tidal stages. By developing an automated approach to generating satellite-derived elevation data based on a 30 year time series of observations managed within the Digital Earth Australia (DEA) platform, it was possible to produce the first continental-scale three-dimensional model of the intertidal zone.

*Accuracy*

To assess the accuracy of NIDEM, we compared modelled elevations against three independent elevation and bathymetry validation datasets: the DEM of Australia derived from LiDAR 5 Metre Grid (Geoscience Australia, 2015), elevation data collected from Real Time Kinematic (RTK) GPS surveys (Danaher & Collett, 2006; HydroSurvey Australia, 2009), and 1.0 m resolution multibeam bathymetry surveys (Solihuddin et al., 2016). We assessed overall accuracy across three distinct intertidal environments: sandy beaches and shores, tidal flats, and rocky shores and reefs:

 - Sandy beaches and shores, 5 sites: Pearson's correlation = 0.92, Spearman's correlation = 0.93, RMSE +/- 0.41 m
 - Tidal flats, 9 sites: Pearson's correlation = 0.78, Spearman's correlation = 0.81, RMSE +/- 0.39 m
 - Rocky shores and reefs, 7 sites: Pearson's correlation = 0.46, Spearman's correlation = 0.79, RMSE +/- 2.98 m

*Limitations*

NIDEM covers the exposed intertidal zone which includes sandy beaches and shores, tidal flats and rocky shores and reefs. The model excludes intertidal vegetation communities such as mangroves.

Areas with comparatively steep coastlines and small tidal ranges are poorly captured in the 25 m spatial resolution input Landsat data and resulting NIDEM model. This includes much of the south eastern and southern Australian coast (e.g. New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania).

Poor validation results for rocky shore and reef sites within the southern Kimberly region highlighted limitations in the NIDEM model that occur when the global OTPS TPX08 Atlas Tidal Model was unable to predict complex and asynchronous local tidal patterns. This is likely to also reduce model accuracy in complex estuaries and coastal wetlands where river flow or vegetative resistance causes hydrodynamic attenuation in tidal flow.

The complex temporal behaviour of tides mean that a sun synchronous sensor like Landsat does not observe the full range of the tidal cycle at all locations. This causes spatial bias in the proportion of the tidal range observed in different regions, which can prevent NIDEM from providing elevation data for areas of the intertidal zone exposed or inundated at the extremes of the tidal range. Accordingly, NIDEM provides elevation data for the portion of the tidal range observed by Landsat, rather than the full tidal range.

While image compositing and masking methods have been applied to remove the majority of noise and non-tidal artefacts from NIDEM, issues remain in several locations. It is recommended that the data be used with caution in the following areas: 

 - The Recherche Archipelago in southern Western Australia
 - Port Phillip Bay in Victoria
 - The eastern coast of Tasmania and King Island
 - Saunders Reef and surrounds in the northern Coral Sea

High Tide and Low Tide Composites 2.0.0
               
The High and Low Tide Composites product is composed of two surface reflectance composite mosaics of Landsat TM and ETM+ (Landsat 5 and Landsat 7 respectively) and OLI (Landsat 8) surface reflectance data (Li et al., 2012). These products have been produced using Digital Earth Australia (DEA). 
The two mosaics allow cloud free and noise reduced visualisation of the shallow water and inter-tidal coastal regions of Australia, as observed at high and low tide respectively (Sagar et al. 2018).
                
The composites are generated utilising the geomedian approach of Roberts et al (2017) to ensure a valid surface reflectance spectra suitable for uses such as habitat mapping. 
The time range used for composite generation in each polygon of the mosaic is tailored to ensure dynamic coastal features are captured whilst still allowing a clean and cloud free composite to be generated. The concepts of the Observed Tidal Range (OTR), and Highest and Lowest Observed Tide (HOT, LOT) are discussed and described fully in Sagar et al. (2017) and the product description for the ITEM v 1.0 product (Geoscience Australia, 2016).
                            
*Overview*
                
Inter-tidal zones are difficult regions to characterise due to the dynamic nature of the tide. They are highly changeable environments, subject to forcings from the land, sea and atmosphere and yet they form critical habitats for a wide range of organisms from birds to fish and sea grass. 
By harnessing the long archive of satellite imagery over Australia's coastal zones in the DEA and pairing the images with regional tidal modelling, the archive can be sorted by tide height rather than date, enabling the inter-tidal zone to be viewed at any stage of the tide regime.
                
The High Low Tide Composites (HLTC_25) product is composed of two mosaics, distinguished by tide height, representing a composite image of the synthetic geomedian surface reflectance from Landsats 5 TM, Landsat 7 ETM+ and Landsat 8 OLI NBAR data (Li et al., 2012; Roberts et al., 2017). Oregon State Tidal Prediction (OTPS) software (Egbert and Erofeeva, 2002, 2010) was used to generate tide heights, relative to mean sea level, for the Australian continental coastline, split into 306 distinct tidal regions. 
These time and date stamped tidal values were then attributed to all coastal tile observations for their time of acquisition, creating a range of observed tide heights for the Australian coastline. The two mosaics in HLTC_25 are composited from the highest and lowest 20 % of observed tide in the ensemble and are termed HOT and LOT respectively. 
A geomedian composite for each Landsat band is calculated from the tiles in each ensemble subset to produce the respective HOT and LOT composites. Note that Landsat 7 ETM+ observations are excluded after May 2003 due to a large number of data artifacts.
                
The time range used for composite generation in each of the 306 polygons of the mosaics are tailored to ensure dynamic coastal features are captured whilst still allowing a clean and cloud free composite to be generated. 
The maximum epoch for which the products are calculated is between 1995-2017, although this varies due to data resolution and observation quality. The product also includes a count of clear observations per pixel for both mosaics and attribute summaries per polygon that include the date range, the highest and lowest modeled astronomical tide as well as the highest and lowest observed tide for that time range, the total observation count and the maximum count of observations for any one pixel in the polygon, the polygon ID number (from 1 to 306), the polygon centroid in longitude and latitude and the count of tide stages attributed to every observation used in that polygon of the mosaic. For the count of tidal stage observations, e = ebbing tide, f = flowing tide, ph = peak high tide and pl = peak low tide. 
The tide stages were calculated bycomparison to the modeled tide data for 15 minutes either side of the observation to determine the ebb, flow or peak movement of the tide.
                
Observations are filtered to remove poor quality observations including cloud, cloud shadow and band saturation (of any band).

High Tide and Low Tide Composites 2.0.0
               
The High and Low Tide Composites product is composed of two surface reflectance composite mosaics of Landsat TM and ETM+ (Landsat 5 and Landsat 7 respectively) and OLI (Landsat 8) surface reflectance data (Li et al., 2012). These products have been produced using Digital Earth Australia (DEA). 
The two mosaics allow cloud free and noise reduced visualisation of the shallow water and inter-tidal coastal regions of Australia, as observed at high and low tide respectively (Sagar et al. 2018).
                
The composites are generated utilising the geomedian approach of Roberts et al (2017) to ensure a valid surface reflectance spectra suitable for uses such as habitat mapping. 
The time range used for composite generation in each polygon of the mosaic is tailored to ensure dynamic coastal features are captured whilst still allowing a clean and cloud free composite to be generated. The concepts of the Observed Tidal Range (OTR), and Highest and Lowest Observed Tide (HOT, LOT) are discussed and described fully in Sagar et al. (2017) and the product description for the ITEM v 1.0 product (Geoscience Australia, 2016).
                            
*Overview*
                
Inter-tidal zones are difficult regions to characterise due to the dynamic nature of the tide. They are highly changeable environments, subject to forcings from the land, sea and atmosphere and yet they form critical habitats for a wide range of organisms from birds to fish and sea grass. 
By harnessing the long archive of satellite imagery over Australia's coastal zones in the DEA and pairing the images with regional tidal modelling, the archive can be sorted by tide height rather than date, enabling the inter-tidal zone to be viewed at any stage of the tide regime.
                
The High Low Tide Composites (HLTC_25) product is composed of two mosaics, distinguished by tide height, representing a composite image of the synthetic geomedian surface reflectance from Landsats 5 TM, Landsat 7 ETM+ and Landsat 8 OLI NBAR data (Li et al., 2012; Roberts et al., 2017). Oregon State Tidal Prediction (OTPS) software (Egbert and Erofeeva, 2002, 2010) was used to generate tide heights, relative to mean sea level, for the Australian continental coastline, split into 306 distinct tidal regions. 
These time and date stamped tidal values were then attributed to all coastal tile observations for their time of acquisition, creating a range of observed tide heights for the Australian coastline. The two mosaics in HLTC_25 are composited from the highest and lowest 20 % of observed tide in the ensemble and are termed HOT and LOT respectively. 
A geomedian composite for each Landsat band is calculated from the tiles in each ensemble subset to produce the respective HOT and LOT composites. Note that Landsat 7 ETM+ observations are excluded after May 2003 due to a large number of data artifacts.
                
The time range used for composite generation in each of the 306 polygons of the mosaics are tailored to ensure dynamic coastal features are captured whilst still allowing a clean and cloud free composite to be generated. 
The maximum epoch for which the products are calculated is between 1995-2017, although this varies due to data resolution and observation quality. The product also includes a count of clear observations per pixel for both mosaics and attribute summaries per polygon that include the date range, the highest and lowest modeled astronomical tide as well as the highest and lowest observed tide for that time range, the total observation count and the maximum count of observations for any one pixel in the polygon, the polygon ID number (from 1 to 306), the polygon centroid in longitude and latitude and the count of tide stages attributed to every observation used in that polygon of the mosaic. For the count of tidal stage observations, e = ebbing tide, f = flowing tide, ph = peak high tide and pl = peak low tide. 
The tide stages were calculated bycomparison to the modeled tide data for 15 minutes either side of the observation to determine the ebb, flow or peak movement of the tide.
                
Observations are filtered to remove poor quality observations including cloud, cloud shadow and band saturation (of any band).

The Intertidal Extents Model (ITEM v2.0) product analyses GAâs historic archive of satellite imagery to derive a model of the spatial extents of the intertidal zone throughout the tidal cycle. The model can assist in understanding the relative elevation profile of the intertidal zone, 
delineating exposed areas at differing tidal heights and stages.

The product differs from previous methods used to map the intertidal zone which have been predominately focused on analysing a small number of individual satellite images per location (e.g Ryu et al., 2002; Murray et al., 2012). 
By utilising a full 30 year time series of observations and a global tidal model (Egbert and Erofeeva, 2002), the methodology enables us to overcome the requirement for clear, high quality observations acquired concurrent to the time of high and low tide.

*Accuracy and limitations*
                  
Due the sun-synchronous nature of the various Landsat sensor observations; it is unlikely that the full physical extents of the tidal range in any cell will be observed. Hence, terminology has been adopted for the product to reflect the highest modelled tide observed in a given cell (HOT) and the lowest modelled tide observed (LOT) (see Sagar et al. 2017). These measures are relative to Mean Sea Level, and have no consistent relationship to Lowest (LAT) and Highest Astronomical Tide (HAT).

The inclusion of the lowest (LMT) and highest (HMT) modelled tide values for each tidal polygon indicates the highest and lowest tides modelled for that location across the full time series by the OTPS model. The relative difference between the LOT and LMT (and HOT and HMT) heights gives an indication of the extent of the tidal range represented in the Relative Extents Model.

As in ITEM v1.0, v2.0 contains some false positive land detection in open ocean regions. These are a function of the lack of data at the extremes of the observed tidal range, and features like glint and undetected cloud in these data poor regions/intervals. Methods to isolate and remove these features are in development for future versions. Issues in the DEA archive and data noise in the Esperance, WA region off Cape Le Grande and Cape Arid (Polygons 236,201,301) has resulted in significant artefacts in the model, and use of the model in this area is not recommended.
                
The Confidence layer is designed to assess the reliability of the Relative Extent Model. Within each tidal range percentile interval, the pixel-based standard deviation of the NDWI values for all observations in the interval subset is calculated. The average standard deviation across all tidal range intervals is then calculated and retained as a quality indicator in this product layer.

The Confidence Layer reflects the pixel based consistency of the NDWI values within each subset of observations, based on the tidal range. Higher standard deviation values indicate water classification changes not based on the tidal cycle, and hence lower confidence in the extent model.

Possible drivers of these changes include:

Inadequacies of the tidal model, due perhaps to complex coastal bathymetry or estuarine structures not captured in the model. These effects have been reduced in ITEM v2.0 compared to previous versions, through the use of an improved tidal modelling frameworkChange in the structure and exposure of water/non-water features NOT driven by tidal variation. 
For example, movement of sand banks in estuaries, construction of man-made features (ports etc.).Terrestrial/Inland water features not influenced by the tidal cycle.

*Overview*

The Intertidal Extents Model product is a national scale gridded dataset characterising the spatial extents of the exposed intertidal zone, at intervals of the observed tidal range (Sagar et al. 2017).The current version (2.0) utilises all Landsat observations (5, 7, and 8) for Australian coastal regions (excluding off-shore Territories) between 1986 and 2016 (inclusive).

ITEM v2.0 has implemented an improved tidal modelling framework (see Sagar et al. 2018) over that utilised in ITEM v1.0. The expanded Landsat archive within the Digital Earth Australia (DEA) has also enabled the model extent to be increased to cover a number of offshore reefs, including the full Great Barrier Reef and southern sections of the Torres Strait Islands. 
The DEA archive and new tidal modelling framework has improved the coverage and quality of the ITEM v2.0 relative extents model, particularly in regions where AGDC cell boundaries in ITEM v1.0 produced discontinuities or the imposed v1.0 cell structure resulted in poor quality tidal modelling (see Sagar et al. 2017).

The DEA archive and new tidal modelling framework has improved the coverage and quality of the ITEM v2.0 relative extents model, particularly in regions where AGDC cell boundaries in ITEM v1.0 produced discontinuities or the imposed v1.0 cell structure resulted in poor quality tidal modelling (see Sagar et al. 2017).

The National ASTER Map of Australia is the parent datafile of a dataset that comprises a set of 14+ geoscience products made up of mosaiced ASTER (Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer) scenes across Australia.

ASTER calibration, processing and standardisation approaches have been produced as part of a large multi-agency project to facilitate uptake of these techniques and make them easily integrated with other datasets in a GIS.

Collaborative research, undertaken by Geoscience Australia, the Commonwealth Scientific Research Organisation (CSIRO) and state and industry partners, on the world-class Mt Isa mineral province in Queensland was completed in 2008 as a test-case for these new methods.

For parent datafile information, see the dataset record: http://pid.geoscience.gov.au/dataset/ga/74347


Band ratio: B5/B7

- Blue is well ordered kaolinite, Al-rich muscovite/illite, paragonite, pyrophyllite
- Red is Al-poor (Si-rich) muscovite (phengite)

Useful for mapping:

(1) exposed saprolite/saprock is often white mica or Al-smectite (warmer colours) whereas transported materials are often kaolin-rich (cooler colours);

(2) clays developed over carbonates, especially Al-smectite (montmorillonite, beidellite) will produce middle to warmers colours;

(3) stratigraphic mapping based on different clay-types; and

(4) lithology-overprinting hydrothermal alteration, e.g. Si-rich and K-rich phengitic mica (warmer colours).

Combine with Ferrous iron in MgOH and FeOH content products to look for evidence of overlapping/juxtaposed potassic metasomatism in ferromagnesian parents rocks (e.g. Archaean greenstone associated Au mineralisation) +/- associated distal propyllitic alteration (e.g. chlorite, amphibole)

For parent datafile information, see the dataset record: http://pid.geoscience.gov.au/dataset/ga/74347


Band ratio: (B5+B7)/B6

- Blue is low abundance
- Red is high abundance

(potentially includes: phengite, muscovite, paragonite, lepidolite, illite, brammalite, montmorillonite, beidellite, kaolinite, dickite)

Useful for mapping:

(1) exposed saprolite/saprock;

(2) clay-rich stratigraphic horizons;

(3) lithology-overprinting hydrothermal phyllic (e.g. white mica) alteration; and

(4) clay-rich diluents in ore systems (e.g. clay in iron ore).

Also combine with AlOH composition to help map:

(1) exposed in situ parent material persisting through âcoverâ which can be expressed as:

(a) more abundant AlOH content +

(b) long-wavelength (warmer colour) AlOH composition (e.g. muscovite/phengite)

For parent datafile information, see the dataset record: http://pid.geoscience.gov.au/dataset/ga/74347


Band ratio: (B6+B8)/B7

- Blue is low content,
- Red is high content

(potentially includes: chlorite, epidote, jarosite, nontronite, gibbsite, gypsum, opal-chalcedony

Useful for mapping:

(1) jarosite (acid conditions) â in combination with ferric oxide content (high);

(2) gypsum/gibbsite â in combination with ferric oxide content (low);

(3) magnesite - in combination with ferric oxide content (low) and MgOH content (moderate-high);

(4) chlorite (e.g. propyllitic alteration) â in combination with Ferrous in MgOH (high); and

(5) epidote (calc-silicate alteration) â in combination with Ferrous in MgOH (low).

Band ratio: B2/B1

- Blue-cyan is goethite rich,
- Green is hematite-goethite,
- Red-yellow is hematite-rich

Useful For:

(1) Mapping transported materials (including palaeochannels) characterised by hematite (relative to geothite). Combine with AlOH composition to find co-located areas of hematite and poorly ordered kaolin to map transported materials; and

(2) hematite-rish areas in drier conditions (eg above the water table) whereas goethite-rich in wetter conditions (eg at/below the water or areas recently exposed). May also be climate driven.

The National ASTER Map of Australia is the parent datafile of a dataset that comprises a set of 14+ geoscience products made up of mosaiced ASTER (Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer) scenes across Australia.

ASTER calibration, processing and standardisation approaches have been produced as part of a large multi-agency project to facilitate uptake of these techniques and make them easily integrated with other datasets in a GIS.

Band ratio: B4/B3

- Blue is low abundance,
- Red is high abundance

Useful for:

(1) Exposed iron ore (hematite-goethite). Use in combination with the âOpaques indexâ to help separate/map dark:

   (a) surface lags (e.g. maghemite gravels) which can be misidentified in visible and false colour imagery; and

   (b) magnetite in BIF and/or bedded iron ore; and

(2) Acid conditions: combine with FeOH Group content to help map jarosite which will have high values in both products.

Mapping hematite versus goethite mapping is NOT easily achieved as ASTERâs spectral bands were not designed to capture diagnostic iron oxide spectral behaviour.

However, some information on visible colour relating in part to differences in hematite and/or goethite content can be obtained using a ratio of B2/B1 especially when this is masked using a B4/B3 to locate those pixels with sufficient iro oxide content.

Band ratio: B5/B4

- Blue is low ferrous iron content in carbonate and MgOH minerals like talc and tremolite.
- Red is high ferrous iron content in carbonate and MgOH minerals like chlorite and actinolite.

Useful for mapping:

(2) talc/tremolite (Mg-rich â cool colours) versus actinolite (Fe-rich â warm colours);

(3) ferrous-bearing carbonates (warm colours) potentially associated with metasomatic âalterationâ;

(4) calcite/dolomite which are ferrous iron-poor (cool colours); and

(5) epidote, which is ferrous iron poor (cool colours) â in combination with FeOH content product (high).

The National ASTER Map of Australia is the parent datafile of a dataset that comprises a set of 14+ geoscience products made up of mosaiced ASTER (Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer) scenes across Australia.

ASTER calibration, processing and standardisation approaches have been produced as part of a large multi-agency project to facilitate uptake of these techniques and make them easily integrated with other datasets in a GIS.

Collaborative research, undertaken by Geoscience Australia, the Commonwealth Scientific Research Organisation (CSIRO) and state and industry partners, on the world-class Mt Isa mineral province in Queensland was completed in 2008 as a test-case for these new methods.

For parent datafile information, see the dataset record: http://pid.geoscience.gov.au/dataset/ga/74347


Band ratio: B5/B4

- Blue is low abundance,
- Red is high abundance

This product can help map exposed âfreshâ (un-oxidised) rocks (warm colours) especially mafic and ultramafic lithologies rich in ferrous silicates (e.g. actinolite, chlorite) and/or ferrous carbonates (e.g. ferroan dolomite, ankerite, siderite).

Applying an MgOH Group content mask to this product helps to isolate ferrous bearing non-OH bearing minerals like pyroxenes (e.g. jadeite) from OH-bearing or carbonate-bearing ferrous minerals like actinolite or ankerite, respectively.

Also combine with the FeOH Group content product to find evidence for ferrous-bearing chlorite (e.g. chamosite).

- Blue is low gypsum content,
- Red is high gypsum content

Useful for mapping:

(1) evaporative environments (e.g. salt lakes) and associated arid aeolian systems (e.g. dunes);

(2) acid waters (e.g. from oxidising sulphides) invading carbonate rich materials including around mine environments; and

(3) hydrothermal (e.g. volcanic) systems.

Band Ratio: B6/B5

- Blue is low content,
- Red is high content

(potentially includes: pyrophyllite, alunite, well-ordered kaolinite)

Useful for mapping:

(1) different clay-type stratigraphic horizons;

(2) lithology-overprinting hydrothermal alteration, e.g. high sulphidation, âadvanced argillicâ alteration comprising pyrophyllite, alunite, kaolinite/dickite; and

(3) well-ordered kaolinite (warmer colours) versus poorly-ordered kaolinite (cooler colours) which can be used for mapping in situ versus transported materials, respectively.

Band ratio: B7/B8

- Blue-cyan is magnesite-dolomite, amphibole, chlorite
- Red is calcite, epidote, amphibole

Useful for mapping:

(1) exposed parent material persisting through "cover";

(2) "dolomitization" alteration in carbonates - combine with Ferrous iron in MgOH product to help separate dolomite versus ankerite;

(3) lithology-cutting hydrothermal (e.g. propyllitic) alteration - combine with FeOH content product and ferrous iron in Mg-OH to isolate chlorite from actinolite versus talc versus epidote; and

(4) layering within mafic/ultramafic intrusives

The National ASTER Map of Australia is the parent datafile of a dataset that comprises a set of 14+ geoscience products made up of mosaiced ASTER (Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer) scenes across Australia.

ASTER calibration, processing and standardisation approaches have been produced as part of a large multi-agency project to facilitate uptake of these techniques and make them easily integrated with other datasets in a GIS.

Collaborative research, undertaken by Geoscience Australia, the Commonwealth Scientific Research Organisation (CSIRO) and state and industry partners, on the world-class Mt Isa mineral province in Queensland was completed in 2008 as a test-case for these new methods.

For parent datafile information, see the dataset record: http://pid.geoscience.gov.au/dataset/ga/74347


Band ratio: (B6+B9)/(B7+B8)

- Blue is low content,
- Red is high content

(potentially includes: calcite, dolomite, magnesite, chlorite, epidote, amphibole, talc, serpentine)

Useful for mapping:

(1) âhydratedâ ferromagnesian rocks rich in OH-bearing tri-octahedral silicates like actinolite, serpentine, chlorite and talc;

(2) carbonate-rich rocks, including shelf (palaeo-reef) and valley carbonates(calcretes, dolocretes and magnecretes); and

(3) lithology-overprinting hydrothermal alteration, e.g. âpropyllitic alterationâ comprising chlorite, amphibole and carbonate.

The nature (composition) of the silicate or carbonate mineral can be further assessed using the MgOH composition product.

Band ratio: B1/B4

- Blue is low abundance,
- Red is high abundance

(potentially includes carbon black (e.g. ash), magnetite, Mn oxides, and sulphides in unoxidised environments)

Useful for mapping:

(1) magnetite-bearing rocks (e.g. BIF);

(2) maghemite gravels;

(3) manganese oxides;

(4) graphitic shales.

Note: (1) and (4) above can be evidence for âreducedâ rocks when interpreting REDOX gradients.

Combine with AlOH group Content (high values) and Composition (high values) products, to find evidence for any invading âoxidisedâ hydrothermal fluids which may have interacted with reduced rocks evident in the Opaques index product.

Band ratio: B13/B10

- Blue is low silica content,
- Red is high silica content

(potentially includes Si-rich minerals, such as quartz, feldspars, Al-clays)

Geoscience Applications:

Broadly equates to the silica content though the intensity (depth) of this reststrahlen feature is also affected by particle size &lt;250 micron.

Useful product for mapping:

(1) colluvial/alluvial materials;

(2) silica-rich (quartz) sediments (e.g. quartzites);

(3) silification and silcretes; and

(4) quartz veins.

Use in combination with quartz index, which is often correlated with the Silica index.
