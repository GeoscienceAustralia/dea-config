description: Water Observations from Space (WOfS) for Cambodia based pn USGS level two landsat surface reflectance. WOfS is produced by using a water classifier to classify when water is observed on the ground surface, next the presence of water is divided by the total observations to create a percentage of water presence over all observations. The WOfS layer was calculated with the datacube-stats.
