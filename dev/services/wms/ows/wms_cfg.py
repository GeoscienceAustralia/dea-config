A `weighted geometric medianâ approach has been used to estimate the median surface reflectance of the barest state (i.e., least vegetation) observed through Landsat-8 OLI observations from 2013 to September 2018 to generate a six-band Landsat-8 Barest Earth pixel composite mosaic over the Australian continent.
The bands include BLUE (0.452 - 0.512), GREEN (0.533 - 0.590), RED, (0.636 - 0.673) NIR (0.851 - 0.879), SWIR1 (1.566 - 1.651) and SWIR2 (2.107 - 2.294) wavelength regions. The weighted median approach is robust to outliers (such as cloud, shadows, saturation, corrupted pixels) and also maintains the relationship between all the spectral wavelengths in the spectra observed through time. The product reduces the influence of vegetation and allows for more direct mapping of soil and rock mineralogy.

Mangrove canopy cover version 1, 25 metre, 100km tile, Australian Albers Equal Area projection (EPSG:3577). Data is only visible at higher resolutions; when zoomed-out the available area will be displayed as a shaded region.

The mangrove canopy cover product provides valuable information about the extent and canopy density of mangroves for each year between 1987 and 2016 for the entire Australian coastline.
The canopy cover classes are:
20-50% (pale green), 50-80% (mid green), 80-100% (dark green).

The product consists of  a sequence (one per year) of 25 meter resolution maps that are generated by analysing the Landsat fractional cover (https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.94250.v1) developed by the Joint Remote Sensing Research Program and the Global Mangrove Watch layers (https://doi.org/10.1071/MF13177) developed by the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency.

The mangrove canopy cover version 1 product has the following caveats:
it underestimates the overall extent of mangroves.
it doesnât detect small mangrove communities i.e. smaller estuaries in NSW and Victoria
that there is localised confusion between mangroves and wooded freshwater wetlands i.e. Melaleuca swamps, and
in some locations dense dwarf/shrub mangroves that are less than 2 metres tall may be mis-labelled as woodland/open forest/closed forest.""",

Water Observations from Space - Filtered Statistics is a set of statistical summaries of the water observations contained in Water Observations from Space.

This product is Water Observations from Space - Filtered Statistics, consisting of a Confidence layer that compares the Water Observations from Space - Statistics water summary to other national water datasets, and the Filtered Water Summary which uses the Confidence to mask areas of the Water Observations from Space - Statistics water summary where Confidence is low.
The Filtered Water Summary provides the long term understanding of the recurrence of water in the landscape, with much of the noise due to misclassification filtered out.

This layer is Filtered Water Summary: A simplified version of the Water Summary, showing the frequency of water observations where the Confidence is above a cutoff level.
This layer gives a noise-reduced view of surface water across Australia. Even though confidence filtering is applied to the Filtered Water Summary, some cloud and shadow, and sensor noise does persist.

Water Observations from Space - Statistics is a set of statistical summaries of the water observations contained in WOfS. The layers available are: the count of clear observations; the count of wet observations; the percentage of wet observations over time.

This product is Water Observations from Space - Statistics, a set of statistical summaries of the WOfS product that combines the many years of WOfS observations into summary products that help the understanding of surface water across Australia. As no confidence filtering is applied to this product, it is affected by noise where misclassifications have occurred in the WOfS water classifications, and hence can be difficult to interpret on its own.
The confidence layer and filtered summary are contained in the Water Observations from Space Statistics - Filtered Summary product, which provide a noise-reduced view of the water summary.

This layer contains Water Summary: what percentage of clear observations were detected as wet (ie. the ratio of wet to clear as a percentage)

Water Observations from Space - Filtered Statistics is a set of statistical summaries of the water observations contained in Water Observations from Space.

This product is Water Observations from Space - Filtered Statistics, consisting of a Confidence layer that compares the Water Observations from Space - Statistics water summary to other national water datasets, and the Filtered Water Summary which uses the Confidence to mask areas of the Water Observations from Space - Statistics water summary where Confidence is low.
The Filtered Water Summary provides the long term understanding of the recurrence of water in the landscape, with much of the noise due to misclassification filtered out.

This layer is Confidence: the degree of agreement between water shown in the Water Summary and other national datasets.
The Confidence layer provides understanding of whether the water shown in the Water Summary agrees with where water should exist in the landscape, such as due to sloping land or whether water has been detected in a location by other means.

                a topographic position index and topographic ruggedness. Topographic Position Index (TPI) measures 
                the topographic slope position of landforms. Ruggedness informs on the roughness of the surface and 
                is calculated as the standard deviation of elevations. Both these terrain attributes are therefore 
                scale dependent and will vary according to the size of the analysis window. Based on an algorithm 
                developed by Lindsay et al. (2015) we have generated multi-scale topographic position model over the 
                Australian continent using 3 second resolution (~90m) DEM derived from the Shuttle Radar Topography 
                Mission (SRTM). The algorithm calculates topographic position scaled by the corresponding ruggedness 
                across three spatial scales (window sizes) of 0.2-8.1 Km; 8.2-65.2 Km and 65.6-147.6 Km. The derived 
                ternary image captures variations in topographic position across these spatial scales (blue local, 
                green intermediate and red regional) and gives a rich representation of nested landform features that

Fractional Cover Percentiles version 2.0.0, 25 metre, 100km tile, Australian Albers Equal Area projection (EPSG:3577). Data is only visible at higher resolutions; when zoomed-out the available area will be displayed as a shaded region.
Fractional cover provides information about the the proportions of green vegetation, non-green vegetation (including deciduous trees during autumn, dry grass, etc.), and bare areas for every 25m x 25m ground footprint. Fractional cover provides insight into how areas of dry vegetation and/or bare soil and green vegetation are changing over time.  The percentile summaries are designed to make it easier to analyse and interpret fractional cover.  For example the 90th percentile of bare soil for a particular year will identify areas that have experienced a high portion of bare soil during that year.  The fractional cover algorithm was developed by the Joint Remote Sensing Research Program.
This contains a (10th, 50th and 90th percentile) for green vegetation observations acquired in each full calendar year (1st of January - 31st December) from 1987 to the most recent full calendar year.

Fractional Cover Percentiles version 2.0.0, 25 metre, 100km tile, Australian Albers Equal Area projection (EPSG:3577). Data is only visible at higher resolutions; when zoomed-out the available area will be displayed as a shaded region.
Fractional cover provides information about the the proportions of green vegetation, non-green vegetation (including deciduous trees during autumn, dry grass, etc.), and bare areas for every 25m x 25m ground footprint. Fractional cover provides insight into how areas of dry vegetation and/or bare soil and green vegetation are changing over time.  The percentile summaries are designed to make it easier to analyse and interpret fractional cover.  For example the 90th percentile of bare soil for a particular year will identify areas that have experienced a high portion of bare soil during that year.  The fractional cover algorithm was developed by the Joint Remote Sensing Research Program.
This contains a (10th, 50th and 90th percentile) for bare soil observations acquired in each full calendar year (1st of January - 31st December) from 1987 to the most recent full calendar year.
