Mangrove canopy cover version 1, 25 metre, 100km tile, Australian Albers Equal Area projection (EPSG:3577). Data is only visible at higher resolutions; when zoomed-out the available area will be displayed as a shaded region.

The mangrove canopy cover product provides valuable information about the extent and canopy density of mangroves for each year between 1987 and 2016 for the entire Australian coastline.
The canopy cover classes are:
20-50% (pale green), 50-80% (mid green), 80-100% (dark green).

The product consists of  a sequence (one per year) of 25 meter resolution maps that are generated by analysing the Landsat fractional cover (https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.94250.v1) developed by the Joint Remote Sensing Research Program and the Global Mangrove Watch layers (https://doi.org/10.1071/MF13177) developed by the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency.

The mangrove canopy cover version 1 product has the following caveats:
it underestimates the overall extent of mangroves.
it doesn’t detect small mangrove communities i.e. smaller estuaries in NSW and Victoria
that there is localised confusion between mangroves and wooded freshwater wetlands i.e. Melaleuca swamps, and
in some locations dense dwarf/shrub mangroves that are less than 2 metres tall may be mis-labelled as woodland/open forest/closed forest.""",

Water Observations from Space - Filtered Statistics is a set of statistical summaries of the water observations contained in Water Observations from Space.

This product is Water Observations from Space - Filtered Statistics, consisting of a Confidence layer that compares the Water Observations from Space - Statistics water summary to other national water datasets, and the Filtered Water Summary which uses the Confidence to mask areas of the Water Observations from Space - Statistics water summary where Confidence is low.
The Filtered Water Summary provides the long term understanding of the recurrence of water in the landscape, with much of the noise due to misclassification filtered out.

This layer is Filtered Water Summary: A simplified version of the Water Summary, showing the frequency of water observations where the Confidence is above a cutoff level.
This layer gives a noise-reduced view of surface water across Australia. Even though confidence filtering is applied to the Filtered Water Summary, some cloud and shadow, and sensor noise does persist.

Water Observations from Space - Statistics is a set of statistical summaries of the water observations contained in WOfS. The layers available are: the count of clear observations; the count of wet observations; the percentage of wet observations over time.

This product is Water Observations from Space - Statistics, a set of statistical summaries of the WOfS product that combines the many years of WOfS observations into summary products that help the understanding of surface water across Australia. As no confidence filtering is applied to this product, it is affected by noise where misclassifications have occurred in the WOfS water classifications, and hence can be difficult to interpret on its own.
The confidence layer and filtered summary are contained in the Water Observations from Space Statistics - Filtered Summary product, which provide a noise-reduced view of the water summary.

This layer contains Wet Count: how many times water was detected in observations that were clear

Water Observations from Space - Statistics is a set of statistical summaries of the water observations contained in WOfS. The layers available are: the count of clear observations; the count of wet observations; the percentage of wet observations over time.

This product is Water Observations from Space - Statistics, a set of statistical summaries of the WOfS product that combines the many years of WOfS observations into summary products that help the understanding of surface water across Australia. As no confidence filtering is applied to this product, it is affected by noise where misclassifications have occurred in the WOfS water classifications, and hence can be difficult to interpret on its own.
The confidence layer and filtered summary are contained in the Water Observations from Space Statistics - Filtered Summary product, which provide a noise-reduced view of the water summary.

This layer contains Water Summary: what percentage of clear observations were detected as wet (ie. the ratio of wet to clear as a percentage)

Water Observations from Space - Filtered Statistics is a set of statistical summaries of the water observations contained in Water Observations from Space.

This product is Water Observations from Space - Filtered Statistics, consisting of a Confidence layer that compares the Water Observations from Space - Statistics water summary to other national water datasets, and the Filtered Water Summary which uses the Confidence to mask areas of the Water Observations from Space - Statistics water summary where Confidence is low.
The Filtered Water Summary provides the long term understanding of the recurrence of water in the landscape, with much of the noise due to misclassification filtered out.

This layer is Confidence: the degree of agreement between water shown in the Water Summary and other national datasets.
The Confidence layer provides understanding of whether the water shown in the Water Summary agrees with where water should exist in the landscape, such as due to sloping land or whether water has been detected in a location by other means.

                "abstract": """A Multi-scale topographic position map of Australia has been generated by combining a 
topographic position index and topographic ruggedness. Topographic Position Index (TPI) measures the topographic slope 
position of landforms. The TPI compares the mean elevation of a specific neighbourhood area with the elevation value of 
central cell. This is done for every cell or pixel in the DEM to derive the relative topographic position (e.g. upper, 
middle and lower landscape elements). Ruggedness informs on the roughness of the surface and is calculated as the 
standard deviation of elevations. Both these terrain attributes are therefore scale dependant and will vary according 
to the size of the analysis window. Based on an algorithm developed by Lindsay et al. (2015) we have generated 
multi-scale topographic position model over the Australian continent using 3 second resolution (~90m) DEM derived from 
the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM). The algorithm calculates topographic position scaled by the corresponding 
ruggedness across three spatial scales (window sizes) of 0.2-8.1 Km; 8.2-65.2 Km and 65.6-147.6 Km. The derived ternary 
image captures variations in topographic position across these spatial scales (red local, green intermediate and blue 
regional) and gives a rich representation of nested landform features that have broad application in understanding 
geomorphological and hydrological processes and in mapping regolith and soils over the Australian continent.
