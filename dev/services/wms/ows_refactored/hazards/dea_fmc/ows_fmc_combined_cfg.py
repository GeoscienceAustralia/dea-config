This product calculates the Fuel Moisture Content (FMC) of vegetation which is the percentage of water mass relative to dry mass in living vegetation.

Values range from 0–300%, representing, by weight percent, the amount of water in leaves compared to dry plant material. A value of 0% would indicate that there is no water content. A value of 100% indicates there is an equal weight of water and dry plant material. A value of 300% would mean there is approximately three times as much water as dry plant material. Values in the range of 0–150% are particularly relevant to fire behaviour analysis, as this range is strongly associated with changes in vegetation flammability and the likelihood of ignition.

This product presents pixel-level FMC values for each corresponding Sentinel-2 (A, B and C) scene since July 2015.
